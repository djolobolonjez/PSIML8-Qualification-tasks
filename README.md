# PSIML8-Qualification-tasks
These are my solutions for the problems that were given as a part of a qualification round for Petnica Summer Institute of Machine Learning (PSIML8).
Problems included using some of the libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and PIL.

* The first problem was about data processing and manipulation of the data given as a bunch of JSON files.
* The second problem was about image processing, and the main goal was to recognize various objects that were located in the images. After that, tasks were about solving some algorithmic problems using the data collected from the images (e.g. finding the shortest path).
